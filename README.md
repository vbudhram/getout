Location based event scheduling web application

This was a group project created for my database course. This was a web application whose goal was to let its users “get-out” of their house. It allowed users to create an manage many events very easily. This project was a simplified version of meetup.com. Also, because this project was for a database course, it had an emphasis on searching and generating different statistics on all the events created. Some of the technologies used were Oracle 11g, php, jquery and knockout.js
